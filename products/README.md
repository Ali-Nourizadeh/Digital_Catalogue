# Behkooshan, the products

The stones Behkooshan sells, one to a cell: found by name, colour, type and
origin, each with a page of its own and the texture file the brand published
for it, to download at the quality it was published at.

Drawn in the language of the digital catalogue (branch `Behkooshan-catalogue`)
rather than the old site's: white paper, the catalogue's printed green for
titles and filled controls, hairline rules, no radius, and the brand's cut
corner on every framed photograph.

    /                          the stones, Persian, right to left
    /en/                       the stones, English, left to right
    /product/<slug>/           one stone, Persian
    /en/product/<slug>/        one stone, English
    /wide/...                  the same pages read sideways, as the digital
                               catalogue's sideways reading is: the same
                               addresses under wide/ and wide/en/

The bar on every page switches between the two readings and the two
languages, and its "Catalogue" link goes to the digital catalogue in the
same reading and language. Under it runs the catalogue's reading line.

Every button is cut to the brand's tag, the notch off the top of its
trailing edge (the same form as the catalogue's green tags), and so are the
tag on each stone saying whether it is domestic or imported, the name of
the stone the band is showing, and the way back to the start at the foot of
every page. A stone's name is given in the page's language only; the search
still finds it by its name in either. The filters are always open. Running
text is led at about 1.3 times its size, and on a phone it stands a tenth of
the screen in from either edge. The photograph viewer shows a stone's other
photographs as a strip under the picture.

The motion is the digital catalogue's, with its figures: see the Motion
section of `assets/css/products.css` and the reveal in `products.js`. The
catalogue's drift (a full bleed photograph moving against the scroll) is
not used, because in the catalogue it does not run: its photographs sit in
frames with `overflow: hidden`, which makes each frame the scroller its
view timeline follows, and a frame never scrolls.

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000     # then open http://localhost:8000
```

## What is in this branch

| Folder | What it is |
|---|---|
| `research/products/` | Everything collected about the products from behkooshan.ir: one folder per product with its `product.json`, its original photographs and its texture files. How it was collected, what came from the site and what was translated is in `research/products/README.md`. This is the source; nothing here is edited by the build. |
| `docs/DESIGN.md` | The brand guide as implemented: colour, logo, type, shapes. Sections 1 to 4 are the brand; the rest describes the first site design and is reference, not rule. |
| `assets/fonts`, `assets/logos`, `assets/icons`, `assets/shapes` | The brand's faces, marks, social icons and shapes, as the catalogue uses them. Three interface icons are from Phosphor (MIT, `assets/icons/PHOSPHOR-LICENSE.txt`). |
| `assets/css/tokens.css`, `fonts.css`, `shapes.css` | The brand tokens and the classes for the faces, marks and shapes. |
| `assets/css/products.css` | This site's stylesheet. Its first half is the catalogue's own (bar, controls, cut corner, footer, photograph viewer); its second half is the product catalogue. |
| `assets/css/products-wide.css` | The sideways reading, loaded only by the pages in `wide/`: on a wide window the band of stones the height of the window with the title and filters beside it, then the stones in two rows along the track, each group opened by a green panel, and on a stone's page every photograph a panel of its own run to the trim; on a phone held upright a deck of cards, two columns of two stones to a card. |
| `assets/js/products.js` | The search and the filters; the band of stone surfaces across the head of the listing, each laid over the last with the name of the stone under it; the catalogue's own reveal, move for move (blocks rise, titles are written word by word, photographs are uncovered from the leading edge, and all of it plays again on the way back, except on a phone's deck of cards); and the way back to the filters. The grid is complete without it. |
| `assets/js/products-wide.js` | What the sideways track needs: the mouse wheel turned into travel along it, the page keys, a card at a time on a phone, and the width of the quarry's writing measured. |
| `assets/js/lightbox.js` | The catalogue's photograph viewer, unchanged. |
| `assets/logos/favicon-32.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png` | The catalogue's tab icon drawn from `favicon.svg`, for the browsers that do not take an SVG icon. |
| `tools/collect-from-site.js`, `docs/COLLECT.md` | A script to paste into the browser's console on behkooshan.ir and fa.behkooshan.ir: it collects every page, the store's product data, the media library and every photograph and texture file at its original size into zip files, with a manifest and a list of anything it could not get. `docs/COLLECT.md` is how to run it, in Persian. |
| `data/products.json` | What the pages are built from, written by `tools/derive-products.py`. |
| `media/` | The photographs as webp at 480 to 1600 pixels wide, written by the same tool. |

## Building

```bash
python3 tools/derive-products.py   # research -> media/ and data/products.json
node tools/build-products.mjs      # data -> every page
```

Run the first whenever the research changes and the second whenever the data
or the page templates do. Both are safe to run again.

What the derivation decides, and why, is written at the top of
`tools/derive-products.py`. In short:

- the photographs are shown as webp at a few widths, so a phone downloads a
  phone's worth of pixels; the texture downloads are the original files;
- the old site's listing pictures have its cut corner painted into them, and
  the installation photographs white bars; both are cropped away;
- colour: the site gave a colour to about half the stones. For the rest it is
  read from the slab's photograph and from any colour word in the trade name
  (Jeriba Blue is found among the blue stones). Where the site named a colour,
  the site's word stands. `colour_source` in each record says which.

A stone the research knows only by name (no photograph, type or origin) is
left out of the site until it has something to show. Black Tempest is the one.

## Publishing

The repository has one GitHub Pages site, built from the branch
`Behkooshan-catalogue` as it stands. This site is published in that branch's
`products/` folder: every push here runs `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, which
copies the site into that folder (without the original photographs, the data
and the tools) and commits it there, and Pages then publishes the digital
catalogue at `/` and this one at `/products/`. Edit the product catalogue here
only; the copy in the catalogue branch is overwritten on every push. The bar's
"Catalogue" link relies on that arrangement (`CATALOGUE` at the top of
`tools/build-products.mjs`).

## Fonts

TT Firs Neue is the trial version and may not be published on the brand's
own domain until a commercial web licence is bought from TypeType; see
`docs/DESIGN.md`.
