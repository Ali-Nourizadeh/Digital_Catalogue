   Behkooshan catalogue, read sideways: the parts a horizontal track needs

   The track itself is a native scroll container, so the scrollbar, the
   keyboard, the touch swipe and a trackpad's horizontal gesture all work
   without any help. Two things do not, and this file is those two:

     1. a mouse wheel reports deltaY and nothing else, so the vertical
        gesture has to be turned into travel along the track
     2. Page Up and Page Down should turn a panel rather than do nothing

   On a phone the track is a deck of cards instead, and both of those turn
   a card at a time; the rest of the file is what the deck needs measured.

   Loaded only by the wide build. Deleting it leaves the upright version
   untouched; see docs/WIDE.md.

     A notch does not move the track itself. It adds to a distance, and the
     track covers that distance on an ease out whose length grows with it, so
     a long spin travels further and takes longer to come to rest.

     Growing the length with the distance is what makes it feel even. The
     speed an ease out sets off at is its distance over its length, so tying
     the two together leaves that speed the same whatever is pending, and a
     notch landing in the middle of a glide carries on at the speed the last
     one was running at instead of lurching.

     An ease out and not an ease in and out: the track has to leave under the
     hand at once, and the softness belongs at the far end, where it stops.
     The exponent is low, so the speed holds up through most of the glide and
     the curve does its work in the last of it; a steeper one spends its
     speed early and lands the same stop-start the easing is here to remove.

     So it is measured here.

     The stylesheet sets each of these sections in columns exactly one card

     `--cards` cards. Too few, and the last column has nowhere to go: it is

     and a paragraph goes missing with nothing to say so. That is exactly
     what is measured — the poured box reports a scroll width past its own —
     so the count starts at one and goes up until the spill stops.

     Without this the stylesheet's own figures stand, and they are the number
