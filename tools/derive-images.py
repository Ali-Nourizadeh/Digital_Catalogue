"""
Build the catalogue's image set from the client's originals.

The print PDF places every photograph cropped to an InDesign frame, so the
images embedded in the PDF are sub-rectangles of the real thing. Those are not
what ships: for each one the matching original was found in the client's zip
and that is what is resized here; the mapping below is the record of it.

One source file becomes several widths of the same webp. Nothing is cropped:
the page decides the crop with object-fit, so the same file serves a portrait
slot on a phone and a full bleed plate on a desktop.
